# P5JsGame
A small game made in the P5Js tool, made for a University assignment in 2019.

The project is a small Lion King themed game built using the online P5Js tool, which utilises the P5Js JavaScript library for creative coding. It is primarily built for
making programming accessible to artists, designers and educators.
